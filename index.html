        Olive Oil

        <p>
          Today I will discuss the pros and cons of olive oil. Olive oil is a healthy oil used in cooking. As someone who has used olive oil for years, I will talk about the pros and cons of using it.

        Pros
      </p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Healthier than traditional oils like canola and vegetable oil.
        </li>
        <li>
           Has a lower smoke point than other oils. Might not be best for deep-frying.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p>
      Cons
      </p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Olive oil has a nice taste and gives things like salads and ice cream more flavour.
        </li>
         <li>
          It has a noticeable flavour, unlike other oils which don't impart flavour onto the food they cook. 
         </li>
          <li>
            Great alternative to things like peanut oil, which some people might be allergic to.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is pricier than other oils. Getting olive oil is expensive.
